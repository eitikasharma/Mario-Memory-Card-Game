# Mario Memory Card Game

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.25.

It is a classic game to test your memory within this game. On the screen, there are always two identical images. Start the game by flipping a card. Then try to find another card that has the same image as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with the face down. When you find a pair they are removed from the screen and when you find all the pairs in this memory, you have completed the level.
